Over the past 10 months my work has primarily involved using Monte Carlo generators to simulate signal and background events for the mono-$Z$ dark matter analysis. I was first introduced to \textsc{MadGraph} by simulating $pp \rightarrow ZZ \rightarrow 2e2\nu$ background events. From analyzing these events I learned how to program a logical truth analysis using ROOT. I also investigated how \textsc{MadGraph} handles $Z$/$\gamma$ interference in $pp \rightarrow 2e2\nu$ events. I then worked on simulating mono-$Z$ signal events using both \textsc{MadGraph} and \textsc{Pythia}. This was in an effort to compare with official ATLAS dark matter samples produced using ATHENA.
