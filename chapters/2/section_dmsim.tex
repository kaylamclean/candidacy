MC15 comparison study:
- attempted to generate dark matter events with standalone MadGraph and Pythia to compare with MC15 samples
- wanted to explore possibility of generating our own, fast samples, different masses/couplings etc.
- one issue was converting Pythia output to .root format
- I explored 3 methods: have Pythia write directly to a root tree, write to a .hepmc file, write to a .lhe file, then convert to .root
- was able to get tree method to work but the structure was very different and much more complicated compared to what I had seen
- was able to write to .lhe, then convert to .root using ExRootAnalysis, but only able to access particles with status = 1, 2
- did not thoroughly investigate writing to .hepmc and converting, there is a tool to convert (HepMC Analysis Tool)
- this format/tool may have preserved more complicated status codes

- because I only had access to status 1 and 2, this made it difficult to compare with the MC15 samples
- these included leptons with status codes of 1, 23, 51, and a few others
- status 23 particles come directly from the hard scatter with no radiation, etc.
- it was not as simple as looking at only particles with status 1
- many events had no status 1 leptons (they were 23 or 51 instead), these I ignored (hence larger error bars)
- events with status 1 leptons only ever had 0 or 2 (never 1, 3, 4, ...)
- plotting status 2 particles with MC15 led to better agreement
- comparing status 1 to status 1 also led to good agreement but still inconsistencies in Z mass peak, etc.
- also getting rid of low pT leptons helped a bit
- final plots show only status 1 particles with a 4 GeV cutoff for leptons

- this was abandoned due to time
- in hindsight, would have tried to follow .hepmc route to preserve particle status codes (possibly)
