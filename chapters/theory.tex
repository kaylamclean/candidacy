\subsection{Effective Field Theories}

Effective field theories (EFTs) were the primary models used in Run 1.

- brief overview of the theory\\
- used in Run 1, moved away for Run 2\\
- or move to an appendix?\\

The most relevant caveat of this model to colliders is that the model is only relevant when the mass of the DM particle is much heavier compared to the COM energy.

\subsection{Simplified Models}

In order to account for the breakdown in one of the major approximations of EFTs at 13 TeV, 

- the main model used in Run 2, explain motivation\\
- overview of the theory, different mediator types, ...\\
- started with LO models, now moving towards NLO\\

\subsection{2 Higgs Doublet + Pseudo-Scalar Model}

- motivation\\
- overview of theory\\

\section{The LHC and the ATLAS Detector}

- introduce the LHC, define luminosity, mention beam energy, beam structure, ...\\
- overview of four main detectors\\
- summary of detector subsystems: inner detector, EM calorimeter, HAD calorimeter, muon spectrometer\\
- trigger, object reconstruction, missing transverse energy\\
