\section{Event Selection Optimization}
- new variables (MET significance)\\
- signal/background or significance optimization, ...\\

\section{Applying the \gjets Method to Data}

- continue efforts with the \gjets method\\
- try MET cut before reweighting?\\
- obtain weights from MC?\\
- define a validation region\\
- apply weights to data, compare with MC to test closure\\
- implementation in MonoZUVic\\

% --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Signal Models}
- s-channel simplified models at NLO
- t-channel signals: Bell model (mediator-Z diagram), less simplified model

It should also be noted that, in the time since these initial benchmark models were set, next-to-leading order (NLO) models are now being considered instead of the leading order (LO) tree diagrams discussed here. Finally, in addition to these $s$-channel diagrams there also exist $t$-channel processes that are of great interest to the \monoZ search. These will be discussed more in Chapter \ref{chapter:fullRun2}.
