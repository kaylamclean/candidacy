\section{Liquid argon work}
\label{sec:LAr}

The preliminary ATLAS authorship qualifying task for the Ph.D. is to contribute to the liquid argon calorimeter system. This will be done in parallel with the mono-$Z$ analysis, and may involve data quality and monitoring. During my visit to CERN in November I attended LAr Week and met some of the group members there. There are two UVic postdocs at CERN who may be available during my time there in 2017. They are both very active in the liquid argon system, and there may be opportunities to learn about the system from them and work with them directly.
