\subsection{Prospects for 100 fb$^{-1}$}
\label{sec:prospects}

Given that the analysis on the 2015 dataset is ongoing, one may naturally ask what kind of results we would expect if we went from 3.21 fb$^{-1}$ of data to $\sim$100 fb$^{-1}$. The most significant models and masses for the current analysis are given in the centre column of Table \ref{tbl:run2sig}. These numbers were calculated with the latest Moriond 2016 recommendations. For simplicity it is assumed that the same selections will be used with 100 fb$^{-1}$ and the detector conditions are identical (pileup, etc.). Hence, we assume that the amount of signal and background will be scaled by the factor $k = 100/3.21= 31.2$. If we use $ks$ and $kb$ for the number of signal and background events in the formula for significance (Equation \ref{eqn:s}), then one finds that $S \rightarrow \sqrt{k}S$, given the simplifying assumptions.

The last column in Table \ref{tbl:run2sig} shows the prospective significances for 100 fb$^{-1}$ of data for the $ee$ signal region. The $\mu\mu$ signal region shows very similar results. In general the analysis is most sensitive to the low mass $s$-channel vector mediator models as well as some $t$-channel models. The larger dataset will provide greater significances for all of the models. Good evidence for a discovery could be claimed for about 3 times as many models as for the 2015 dataset, although the current analysis may end up excluding some of these.
